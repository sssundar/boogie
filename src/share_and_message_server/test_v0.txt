Curl requests to test the BoogieBackend v0
Last Revised 2016-10-09 by Sushant Sundaresh

-- Local Testing --

(1) Test Presence
http://localhost:8080/presence/?user=sudha&password=password1 works fine - 1,2,3 returned.

(2) Storage paths set up
	Let's try putting something in them, and seeing whether the resulting arrays are ordered properly.
		In each person's folder, let's put 3 files 
			Amma: (0_mani.txt, 1_sushant.txt, 2_sudha.3gp)
			Mani: (2_mani.txt, 1_sushant.txt, 0_sudha.3gp)
			Sushant: (1_mani.txt, 2_sushant.txt, 0_sudha.3gp)
		and let's see if they sort correct on startup by printing the arrays to stdout!
	Works!

(3) Mailbox to check ordering, auth, and lack of state change
http://localhost:8080/check_mailbox/?user=sudha&password=password1 should return 0_mani.txt - yes
http://localhost:8080/check_mailbox/?user=sudha&password=password1 should return 0_mani.txt - yes
http://localhost:8080/check_mailbox/?user=sushant&password=password1 should return nothing - yes
http://localhost:8080/check_mailbox/?user=sushant&password=password0 should return 0_sudha.3gp - yes

(4) Download - with fake files to check deletion
curl -o 0_sudha.txt "http://localhost:8080/download/?user=sushant&password=password0&fname=0_sudha.txt" should have 0 size - yes
curl -o 1_sudha.3gp "http://localhost:8080/download/?user=sushant&password=password1&fname=0_sudha.3gp" should have 0 size - yes
curl -o 2_sudha.3gp "http://localhost:8080/download/?user=sushant&password=password0&fname=0_sudha.3gp" should have >0 size - fails

Deleting file results in timeout - need callback once file served.
Also need to RETURN output of serve_file. Works fine now.

(5) Upload - with fake files, then mailbox + download to make sure state changed properly, for two different users

curl -X POST -F "myFile=@/home/sush/Documents/boogie/src/share_and_message_server/password0_sushant.txt" "http://localhost:8080/upload"

Clear directories
Make a single test file password0_sushant.txt
Check everyone's mailbox
Run the curl command above
Make sure it's in now in everyone's directory with "hi" inside
Check everyone's mailbox - and make sure it's gone from the temporary directory
Try and retrieve it
curl -o test.txt "http://localhost:8080/download/?user=sushant&password=password0&fname=1476048436516_sushant.txt"
Yes! Good.

(6) Test RLE locally only - not worth testing on branch. Just make sure it works with a POST request to the specific url, then try to get the latest RLE
	Works!!
	
-- Testing Remotely With an Android App --

ssh -i test_voip.pem ubuntu@ec2-54-183-116-184.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
scp -i test_voip.pem ~/Documents/boogie/src/voice_share_server/voice_share_server.py ubuntu@ec2-54-183-116-184.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:~

scp -i test_voip.pem ~/Documents/boogie/src/share_and_message_server/boogie_revb_v0.py ubuntu@ec2-54-183-116-184.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:~

ps aux | grep -e python
top.. k .. PID

curl -X POST -F "myFile=@/home/sush/Documents/boogie/src/voice_share_server/test.3gp" ec2-54-183-116-184.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/upload
curl -o test.3gp ec2-54-183-116-184.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/download/?name=test.3gp
curl -X GET ec2-54-183-116-184.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:8080/check_mailbox

Works!

-- Testing Guest Access --
ssh -i test_voip.pem ubuntu@ec2-54-183-116-184.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
scp -i test_voip.pem ~/Documents/boogie/src/share_and_message_server/boogie_revb_v2.py ubuntu@ec2-54-183-116-184.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:~

http://ec2-54-183-116-184.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com:9080/?user=guest&password=password3

Currently, works GREAT with one user, no flicker, clears screen. 

ToDo
	Commit with fake filename, fake passwords, with bug reported in commit.
	
	Clear cache on client side - ridiculous now.. can use longer timeout.
		Test with Amma phone, Appa phone, my phone as thatha, and laptop as balu.
	Need to hash/send hash with samplescreen, and if hash hasn't changed, have server reject setscreen? well, let that be for now.
	Test this thoroughly.
	Work on auto-upgrade as well if you can.	
	Upgrade server and run a clean instance on the right 8080 port, with the right filename
	Release it and test it...

	Test with Balu mama and me viewing simultaneously + all of me, amma, and thatha on the call. Test for lag.
	Then Boogie is shareable to ANYONE - and Patti can send it out herself. But for now, just send it to close family (Suman) with instructions. 
	Update documentation and close this out for a while.
		Socket.io is a must in a future revision. The current one is not privacy concerned + very inefficient on the client side.
