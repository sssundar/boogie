====== sanity-check-hangouts ======
Created Friday 01 July 2016

**Get a hangouts session going, ignoring the display/doodle completely. Test effect of size & frequency on ordering & latency for programmatic messages.** 

From the Hangouts reference on "Writing Apps": //You can store approximately 1MB of data in the shared state object; each delta can be about 10K each. //Elsewhere they state that programattic delta updates can be at maximum 10 per second, with a suspension of 1 second if you exceed that. Expect 300 ms latency. 

So we have 10k, 10Hz to play with with a 300 ms delay. Assume 5Hz, 10k deltas. Allowing 10kBytes, and say in each byte we pack [0-128|bw] for a run, then we see we can take a 1080x1920 = 2,073,600 pixel image with many runs and at best turn it into 16,200 bytes. Not good enough. So we have a limited drawing area, or we use a coarser grid. Say, full screen but 1/4 resolution, which turns into 4050 bytes per delta. and even then, the deltas can be diffs, so even better. We'll start with full-updates, though, at 1/4 resolution and compression, expansion on either end.

The app itself can for now be a Hangouts app run from within Hangouts. I guess the Hangouts API isn't yet allowing other apps to call it.

What I'm seeing on a closer look is that it's not so straightforward to do it this way. 
	Skype has an API documentation that is hard for me to understand
	Hangouts allows internal apps only and I don't find it so simple to set up either
	
Seems to me my best bet for a quick setup is a quick and dirty Python web server with whitelisted inputs from post, which delivers content via GET requests with Javascript to refresh the page. As a first test, I mean. I can run the server on an old laptop or Pi 2 later. For now it'll get me off the ground with this. 

**Ok, so the idea now is: **
1) Set up a HTTP web server in Python with a programatically generated BMP (or a pixel snake) posted to and displayed at the index page, and refresh with JavaScript on the laptop to view
	Set up a POST form (hidden) and send coded text for decoding (with a whitelist and parsing at the server end) to demo error handling, and display the bitmap suggested.
2) Write a simple drawing app (post to website what is drawn, encoded, periodically). View it on a browser on my laptop and see resolution, timing, data usage, lag, etc.

I don't think there are too many security issues here so long as I filter the form input and have only these two interfaces - get and post, without additional parameters or scripts.

Ok, onto (1).

**Set up a HTTP web server in Python using Cherry Py that is publically visible with a domain mapping, which displays "Hello World."**

[*] Installed CherryPy using pip for Python 2.7 using sudo
[*] Found how to change socket mappings so CherryPy servers are publically visible
[*] Wrote Hello World script in Python on port 8080 allowing public connections
[*] Viewed webpage using my phone but only with local IP (192.168.1.5:8080)
	[x] Unable to view webpage using public IP because router apparently can't rewrite internal requests using the external IP
	[x] Unable to view webpage using public IP DNS lookup on Athimber's computer (different router)
	[ ] Can also try Patti's 3G connection on her table (no need, see below)
[*] Set up DuckDNS auto-updater on my Linux computer.
	[ ] Need to check if this works after a reboot (Not Done)
	[*] Not anymore - see below.
[*] Attempting to set up a simple HTTP web server in the cloud so that I don't have to worry about port forwarding on routers I don't own
	[*] Amazon AWS will cost ~100-220 a year depending on how far in advance I pay. 
	[*] It makes no sense in the long term. I can set up a server on my Pi and leave it running, and figure out port forwarding later.
	[*] But for now, it makes sense, even paid. I can use the free tier easily though for testing.
	[*] Created free-tier EC2 instance with SSH, HTTP, and HTTPS ports open, running Ubuntu 14.04 server LTS with limited storage. 
	[*] Downloaded .pem file for SSH but will not be syncing to Github, obviously.
	[*] https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html
	[*] Instance is running in N. California
		[*] DNS ec2-54-67-127-196.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
		[*] ID i-1c115ca9
		[*] to SSH in, from the boogie security folder
			[*] ssh -i boogie-rev-a-1.pem ubuntu[[@ec2-54-67-127-196.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com]]
		[*] Success in SSH
		[*] sudo apt-get update & sudo apt-get install python-pip & pip install cherrypy and we're ready to start!
		[*] Use SCP for file transfer to home directory (~), from the boogie security folder
			[*] scp -i boogie-rev-a-1.pem [[../boogie/src/helloworld.py]] ubuntu[[@ec2-54-67-127-196.us-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com]]:~
		[*] Set up CherryPy and the Hello World code on HTTP (port 80), making sure to use sudo python .. for root priviledges to bind port 80
			[*] Works!! I can access the public IP (DNS) and see Hello World.
			[*] Let's push to Github to preserve this data. Also, let's back up the .pem file somewhere safe.

//Note, if I search for files or html documents that aren't there (e.g. index.html) CherryPy dumps traceback to the user. Not great.//

**Set up a HTTP web server in Python with a programatically generated BMP (or a pixel snake) posted to and displayed at the index page, and refresh with JavaScript on the laptop to view.

Here's the idea. 

[ ] On the laptop, write a Python script that generates a bw array (bitmap) with a snake going from top left to bottom right, updating once every 200 ms (parametric). 
[ ] Save this as a bitmap and see the evolution to make sure it's what you want
[ ] Encode this naively (run length, full, not diff) and decode it to verify the enc/dec scripts locally.
[ ] Set up the webserver so that it has a hidden post & get form with internal decoding, and so that it displays the bitmap on the index. Include whitelists and error handling.
[ ] Use python's equivalent of wget for post to programattically post the snake and watch it evolve, to see what frame skipping, etc. look like. Play with update frequencies, resolution (encoding size). See what Amazon's usage statistics look like just for kicks.

[ ] Work on a basic design for the doodle app - e.g. just drawing. No Skype. 
[ ] Deadline:** July 3nd evening**
[ ] Add in VoIP demo to me alone.
[ ] Test paid options like ScreenMeet with a doodle app to see how much better things can get
[ ] Deadline:** July 4rd evening**

[ ] Demo to Thatha with me, first, then Amma (web-only + actual phone, or Video Conference so he can see she can see).
[ ] Observe and make notes on Thatha's usage patterns 
[ ] Deadline: **July 6th evening**

[ ] Aesthetics - usability - home buttons, see how Thatha uses the tablet, make it easier for his use.
[ ] Remote control of Tablet - Remote Update of App - App without Developer Mode
[ ] Add in VoIP to Amma, Balu mama, Vikram, Suman, ... 
[ ] Make VoIP optional in case of low bandwidth
[ ] Add save-session features for client app?
[ ] Webserver security & authentication
[ ] Cleanup last file so no local data exists on server.
[ ] Look into RPi2 webserver hosting & port forwarding, and network monitoring for security.
